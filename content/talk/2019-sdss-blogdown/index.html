abstract: Data science educators have a unique opportunity to teach students the skills
  they need in their future careers. We know that practical skills matter, like being
  able to wrangle, explore, analyze, and visualize data (preferably using code), but
  what is easy to overlook is teaching students how to communicate about data science
  with other people. Being able to communicate about data, code, and insights gained
  are important skills we can strengthen in the classroom to make a real impact on
  students. I will talk about using the R package "blogdown" for students to build
  an online profile and portfolio, and how students use these sites to connect with
  the online R user community, build expertise in R/data science, and find new jobs
  and opportunities.
