This online book contains a full course where users can learn to:

+ explore, groom, visualize, and analyze data,

+ make all of that reproducible, reusable, and shareable,

+ using R.

I led the effort, along with course author [Jenny Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/) and RStudio intern [Grace Lawley](https://grace.rbind.io), to port a vintage R Markdown website into bookdown. I worked with my former intern, [Desirée De Leon](https://desiree.rbind.io), to design the style of the bookdown website.
